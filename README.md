### 🌟 What is Postman?
- Postman is a powerful API testing tool designed to help developers:

- 📤 Send Requests to APIs (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- 🛠️ Test and Debug backend APIs.
- 🔍 Inspect Responses (e.g., JSON, XML).
- 💾 Save and Reuse API calls.
  
### 🚀 How Postman Helps in Development
- Testing API Endpoints 🧪: Validate API functionality before integrating them into your Dart/Flutter application.
- Inspecting API Data 🔍: View returned data, such as employee records or success statuses.
- Debugging 🐞: Detect backend or integration issues early to avoid unnecessary coding roadblocks.
- 👩‍💻 Employee Registration Form Use Case
- Imagine creating an Employee Registration Form:

#### Frontend: Built using Dart/Flutter.
- Backend: Provides APIs for creating or fetching employee data.
- Postman’s Role: Ensures API endpoints (e.g., POST /register-employee) are functional before integration.
  
#### 📑 Steps to Use Postman with Dart (VS Code)

##### Step 1: Install Postman
- 💻 Download and install Postman from Postman’s website.
- 📂 Set up a new collection to organize your API tests.

##### Step 2: Test Your API with Postman
- Create a Request:
- Select POST as the method.
- Check the response:
  
### 📋 Successful Response:

```dart
{
  "message": "Employee registered successfully",
  "employeeId": 12345
}
```

### ❌ Error Response:

```dart
{
  "error": "Invalid email address"
}
```
